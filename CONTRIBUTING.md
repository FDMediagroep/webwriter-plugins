# I want to contribute!
If you want to contribute that's great! Here are a few tips to get you started.

## Getting started
Follow the getting started guide in README.md to get Webwriter up-and-running
locally.

## 2 spaces
The Webwriter build has a strict 2-spaces indentation rule. Compilation will
fail when this rule is broken. So set your IDE indentation for this project
accordingly.
